# Object Detection and Counting using YOLO

## 📌 **Project Overview**
This project implements **real-time object detection and counting** using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. The objective is to detect multiple objects within images or video frames and display their counts dynamically, making it applicable for tasks like surveillance, traffic analysis, and automated monitoring.

## 💡 **Key Features**
- Detects multiple object classes in real-time
- Draws bounding boxes and labels each detected object
- Displays **live object count** on video frames
- Uses **YOLOv5** pre-trained model for fast and accurate detection
- Integrates with **OpenCV** for video frame processing
